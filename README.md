# Operations on image:

1. Addition with Different Constant Values:

  * Adds a constant value to each pixel in the image. This operation can be used to increase brightness or add certain effects to the image.
2. Subtraction with Different Constant Values:

  * Subtracts a constant value from each pixel in the image. It can be utilized to decrease brightness or create specific visual contrasts.
3. Multiplication with Scaling Factor:

  * Multiplies each pixel value by a scaling factor. When the scaling factor is greater than 1, it enhances the brightness of the image. Conversely, when the scaling factor is less than 1, it darkens the image.
4. Inversion of the Given Image:

  * Inverts the pixel values in the image, resulting in a negative of the original image. This operation can produce intriguing artistic effects or be used for image processing tasks.
